sequencing: simple alignment overlapping example
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The example included here produces OVL records describing the
results of the overlapping step for a very small assembly.  The
example is executed as a script (align_example.sh) that will run a
sample alignment on a set of candidate pairs of sequences.  The
resulting OVL records are compared against a correct key as
verification.

The following will explain how to run the example, and describe the
common execution steps included in the example script. The align
program used as an example here uses a custom compressed fasta-like
format. Tools for converting conventional fasta files into this format
are available upon request.

Setup and Execution
-------------------

The align_example.sh script is meant to be run in-place. Once the
CCTools have been made, it can be executed simply as:
./align_example.sh

--First, the example script builds the alignment tool.

--The example script then creates links to the executable "worker" in
  the dttools/src folder and the executable "assembly_master" in the
  abstractions/sequencing/src/ folder. Thus, the example cannot be run
  until after the CCTools have been made successfully.

--Next, the example script starts a worker running on localhost,
  looking for a master on localhost port 9090. If that port is in use,
  change the example to use a free port.

--The example script next starts the master process, which controls
  the workload execution. The master takes several options (here 3
  candidates per discrete task, and port 9090) and four mandatory
  arguments: the executable to run, the candidate list, the sequence
  library, and an output target. For more on options, run: 
  assembly_master -h

--Once the master process has completed, the output is compared
  against a correct version of the OVL results, and the example
  script waits for the worker to time-out.

--The created files are then deleted (with the option to keep the results)
