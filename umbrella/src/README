Umbrella is a tool for specifying and materializing comprehensive execution environments, from the hardware all the way up to software and data.  A user simply invokes Umbrella with the desired task, and Umbrella determines the minimum mechanism necessary to run the task, whether it be direct execution, a system container, a local virtual machine, or submission to a cloud or grid environment.  We present the overall design of Umbrella and demonstrate its use to precisely execute a high energy physics application and a ray-tracing application across many platforms using a combination of Parrot, Chroot, Docker, VMware, Condor, and Amazon EC2.

Test Cases:
Current there are two test cases, one is for the cms application and the other for povray application.
The test cmd is in the file named `cmd`, and the corresponding specification files are under json_dir.
