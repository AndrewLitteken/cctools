<title>CCTools Network Options</title>

<h1>CCTools Network Options</h2>

When working in a cloud or HPC environment, you may find complex
network conditions such as multiple network interfaces, firewalls,
and other conditions.  The following environment variables can be
used to shape the network behavior of 
Makeflow, Work Queue, Parrot, Chirp, and other tools,
so as to work correctly in these environments.

<h2>IPV6 Support</h2>

IPV6 is supported by all of the CCTools components, however it is not turned
on by default because IPV6 is not reliably deployed at all sites.  You can
enable IPV6 support with the <tt>CCTOOLS_IP_MODE</tt> environment variable.
<p>
To enable both IPV4 and IPV6 support according to the local system configuration: (recommended use)
<pre>
export CCTOOLS_IP_MODE=AUTO
</pre>

To enable <b>only</b> IPV4 support: (the default)
<pre>
export CCTOOLS_IP_MODE=IPV4
</pre>

To enable <b>only</b> IPV6 support: (not recommended; use only for testing IPV6)
<pre>
export CCTOOLS_IP_MODE=IPV6
</pre>

Where it is necessary to combine an address and port together into a single string, an IPV4 combination looks like this:
<pre>
192.168.0.1:9094
</pre>

But an IPV6 combination looks like this:
<pre>
[1234::abcd]:9094
</pre>

<h2>Firewall Port Ranges</h2>

When creating a listening TCP port, the CCTools will, by default, pick any
port available on the machine.  However, some computing sites set up firewall
rules that only permit connections within certain port ranges.  To accommodate
this, set the <tt>TCP_LOW_PORT</tt> and <tt>TCP_HIGH_PORT</tt> environment variables,
and the CCTools will only use ports within that range.
<p>
For example, if your site firewall only allows ports 8000-9000, do this:

<pre>
export TCP_LOW_PORT=8000
export TCP_HIGH_PORT=9000
</pre>

<h2>HTTP Proxies</h2>

if your computing site requires all HTTP requests to be routed through a proxy,
specify that proxy with the <tt>HTTP_PROXY</tt> environment variable.
The value should be a semi-colon separated list of proxy URLs, in order
of preference.  The final entry may be <tt>DIRECT</tt> indicating that
a direct connection should be attempted if all proxy connections fail.
<p>
For example:
<pre>
export HTTP_PROXY=http://proxy01.nd.edu:3128;http://proxy02.nd.edu:3129;DIRECT
</pre>
